![Go](https://github.com/roopakparikh/go-firkinize/workflows/Go/badge.svg)

A go version of firkinize library, also available as a binary that can be used for easy scripting

# Scripting use case

Download the appropriate version of the go-firkinize cli from the github release page

There are only two subcommands avaialble today, more can be added later on.

* get-keystone: will let you query the password for a service (in keystone)
* add-keystone: will add entries for a service in the keystone service catalog but also would create user/password for the service. Password is randomly generated and user name is the name of the service itself.
* create-db: will create database for a service

```shell
./go-firkinize

```

Firkinize will let you add keystone service endpoints and will also let you query it.

The CLI takes a lot of parameter, but in deccaxon environment, they are picked up from the corresponding environment variables so in practice you don't need to supply them you can simply do the following:

```shell
./go-firkinize get-keystone --service-name hagrid
asdfasdfasdf
```

For debugging purposes you can pass in a ``` --debug ``` flag that would spit a lot of information on __stderr__ so that while you debug you can still use the go-firkinize in a shell script and get the output for example.
```
$ HAGRID_PASS=`./go-firkinize --debug get-keystone --service-name hagrid`
2020-10-02T10:21:43.824-0700	DEBUG	cmd/root.go:71	Debug log enabled

$ echo $HAGRID_PASS

```

## get-keystone

Self explanatory

```
./go-firkinize get-keystone --service-name hagrid
asdfasdfasdf
```


## add-keystone

Add service URL to the keystone and also generate password to interact with keystone, you will need to query the password using get-keystone

```
./go-firkinize  add-keystone --service-name hagrid --ingress-suffix hagrid
{"level":"info","ts":1601659793.1173918,"caller":"cfg/cfgmgr.go:84","msg":"service endpoint config successfully"}
{"level":"info","ts":1601659793.1965299,"caller":"cfg/cfgmgr.go:134","msg":"Keystone user config added successfully"}
```

The service-name is obvious, the ingress-suffix is to allow for flexibility to advertise additional suffix for example if you want to advertise qbert/v2 as the suffix instead of just qbert.

## create-db
Self explanatory

```
./go-firkinize create-db --service-name hagrid
{"level":"info","ts":1612943409.0324764,"caller":"cfg/cfgmgr.go:202","msg":"Created DB 'hagrid' successfully"}
{"level":"info","ts":1612943409.0376244,"caller":"cfg/cfgmgr.go:225","msg":"Granted all privileges to DB hagrid"}
```
